I'm a neuroscientist and technologist working on technology to improve human cognition! Currently working as a research scientist in the [Fluid Interfaces Group at the MIT Media Lab.](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/fluid-interfaces/overview/)



Currently I'm working on:

[Improving sleep quality and health](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/sleep-entrainment/overview/) by using mobile/wearable devices to stimulate slow waves in deep sleep
[Improving memory](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/tap-to-remember/overview/) by [implementing Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5798898/) on wearable devices.
Using TMR to weaken the impact of distressing memories.
Closed loop sleep stimulation to help people have more lucid dreams.
[Improving cognition with patterned sensory stimulation](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/programming-body-rhythms/overview/)
